READ ME:

The description of the problem and of what the code should do were given to students as pdfs by professor Allan Gottlieb at NYU.  I have not uploaded the pdfs, but each lab's README file should provide enough of a description to have an idea as to what the code does.

These four labs were homework assignments for my Computer Science Operating Systems class at NYU.
