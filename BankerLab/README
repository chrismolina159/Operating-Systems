About- This program is to model resource allocation with an optimistic resource manager using FIFO and Dijkstra's banker's algorithm.  If a task needs to be aborted, a line is printed out stating which task is aborted and why.  Both the results of the optimistic resource manager and the banker's algorithm are printed once the program is finished.
